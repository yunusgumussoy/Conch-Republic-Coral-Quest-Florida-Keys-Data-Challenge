      "      Tag: abstract, Text: The primary goal of the Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP) is to measure the status and trends of these communities to assist managers in understanding, protecting, and restoring the living marine resources of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Data from the project will be used to determine (1) overall net increase or decrease in stony coral percent cover and stony coral species richness, (2) overall net change in measurable reef community parameters, (3) changes observed in individual reef communities with no overall change on a landscape scale (decreases in one location balanced by increases elsewhere) or changes that are linked to specific regions of the landscape. Each of these potential mechanisms of change will result in different spatial patterns of change. A Sanctuary-wide, rather than a single-location survey, is necessary to detect ecosystem change.\n",
      "      Tag: purpose, Text: This Sanctuary-wide project is documenting the status of reef habitats at 40 reef sites located within 5 of the 9 EPA Water Quality Segments in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Over the duration of the project, the randomly located reefs in this project may show no net decline. Alternatively, some or all the reefs may show a net decline. Data for each successive sampling year will be compared with prior year's data to obtain a broader understanding of the dynamics of the FKNMS coral reef system. As the coral reef monitoring is integrated with the seagrass and water quality programs, the results can be used to focus research on determining causality and can be used to inform and evaluate management decisions. The Coral Reef/ Hardbottom Monitoring Project provides the first real opportunity in the Florida Keys to address these questions at the spatial scales required to detect large-scale patterns and discriminate between hypotheses. CREMP started in 1996 with 160 stations at 40 sites. In 2000/2001 a number of stations were dropped from the study, and several stations were dropped in subsequent years (this includes all of the hardbottom (HB) sites). Each site was reduced to between 2 and 4 stations. From 2001 to 2010 the data are reported using the 97 stations that were sampled during every year of that time period. Starting in 2011 reporting is done for 148 stations. This includes the original 136 stations plus the 12 patch reefs stations that were added.\n",
      "      Tag: supplinf, Text: The CREMP project started in 1996 with 160 stations at 40 sites. Since that time, there have been two major changes (1) In 2000/2001 a number of stations were dropped from the study, and several stations were dropped in subsequent years (this includes all of the hardbottom (HB) sites) based upon a statistical analysis. Each site was reduced to between 2 and 4 stations. (2) In 2011, FWC conducted another statistical analysis and decided to reverse their 2000/2001 decision and begin surveying all stations again, but the size of all stations were reduced. Also, in 2009 6 patch reef sites (2 stations each) were added to the study. The DRTO CREMP project started in 1999 with 3 sites being added. Eight (8) additional sites were added to this part of the survey in approximately 2004. The SECREMP data has been a continuous and consistent data collection effort that began in 2003. All 3 datasets (CREMP, DRTO CREMP, and SECREMP) use consistent methods and data reporting schemas. Prior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information.\n",

A spatial database was created, and a point feature class containing the 313 monitoring stations' locations was also created. Staff then created geodatabase tables from the provided spreadsheets and text files. In addition to these individual program tables, a set of combined tables representing data from all programs were created. Finally, relationship classes were created within the geodatabase to link the station locations and the geodatabase tables containng the collected data. Metadata was then created for the new spatial dataset.\n",
